        <h3>What is engineering</h3>
        <p>Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items,
            including
            bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings.[1] The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range
            of
            more
            specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied
            mathematics,
            applied science, and types of application. See glossary of engineering.</p>

        <h3>What is the history of engineering</h3>
        <p>
            Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel
            and pulley, etc.

            The term engineering is derived from the word engineer, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an
            engine'er (literally, one who builds or operates a siege engine) referred to "a constructor of military
            engines."[6] In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, i.e., a mechanical
            contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have
            survived to the present day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

            The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium (c. 1250),
            meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."[7]

            Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical
            discipline, the term civil engineering[5] entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those
            specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of
            military engineering.

        <h3>What is Computer Science</h3>
        <p>Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines and computation itself.[1] As
            a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation
            and information to the practical issues of implementing computational systems in hardware and
            software.[2][3]

            Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. For example, the theory of computation
            concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them, while
            computer graphics or computational geometry emphasize more specific applications. Algorithms and data
            structures have been called the heart of computer science.[4] Programming language theory considers
            approaches to the description of computational processes, while computer programming involves the use of
            them to create complex systems. Computer architecture describes construction of computer components and
            computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence aims to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as
            problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and
            animals. A digital computer is capable of simulating various information processes.[5] The fundamental
            concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.[6] Computer scientists usually
            focus on academic research. The Turing Award is generally</p>
